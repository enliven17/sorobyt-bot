Compose the Future on Stellar
The best smart contract platforms aren't just built—they're built together. Composability is key to a thriving ecosystem, and that starts with you. Instead of building from scratch, join us for the second of our mini-hackathon series where we spotlight and build directly on top of real, live projects on Stellar.

This month’s featured projects are Soroswap and DeFindex, two powerful DeFi protocols developed by the PaltaLabs team and driving innovation on Stellar. Soroswap is a decentralized exchange and aggregator that guarantees users the best price across liquidity sources, while DeFindex offers yield strategies as a service—making it simple to deploy, manage, and earn from automated DeFi vaults. Built to work seamlessly together, these protocols are perfect for hacking on in tandem—and the PaltaLabs team will be actively supporting participants throughout the hackathon!

Intro to Soroswap.Finance:
Soroswap.Finance is an open-source protocol that enables users to exchange one asset for another without relying on a centralized party. It also tackles the problem of liquidity fragmentation across Stellar. The development of Soroswap.Finance and its user interface is led by the PaltaLabs team.

Soroswap.Finance includes:

Soroswap AMM: An Automated Market Maker that facilitates token swaps and liquidity provision. This is where users can provide liquidity to pools and trade between assets. If you just need a simple swap between two assets, this is the simplest way to go!
Soroswap Aggregator: A smart contract that executes trades across multiple liquidity pools based on predefined instructions, enabling advanced routing and split trades for better execution.
Soroswap Swap Route API: The core engine of the aggregator. This API calculates the best way to split a trade across available routes, which can then be executed using the Aggregator contract.

Intro to DeFindex:
DeFindex is an innovative solution that enables wallet builders to offer yield-generating accounts to their users in a simple and secure way. By leveraging a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies, DeFindex streamlines the process of earning yield.

DeFindex Core Components:

Strategies: Smart contracts that connect to underlying DeFi protocols and execute predefined steps to maximize returns on specific assets.
Vaults: The user-facing smart contracts. Each vault can support multiple assets and strategies, managing how funds are allocated. Wallets can integrate these vaults and earn a share of their users’ yield.
Why DeFindex:

Easy to use: One-click yield for users.
Automated & secure: Smart contracts manage everything.
High returns: Earnings are reinvested automatically.
Built for developers: Simple tools and customizable integrations.
User-controlled & transparent: No custodial risk—users stay in control.
